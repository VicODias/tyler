         <p class="text">Long before he emerged as a significant figure in alternative hip-hop, Tyler, the Creator (real name, Tyler Gregory Okonma) was profiled in a 2008 Los Angeles Times story about budding rappers in the city's high schools. Only 16 at the time, Tyler was described as "a little miniature Andre 3000" who "operates at a significantly higher voltage than the average teen." At the time Tyler was already publishing a magazine called Odd Future, a name he would be associated with later on. Raised in the same town (Hawthorne) as the Beach Boys, Tyler was born of mixed Nigerian, African American and white Canadian heritage. By the time he'd graduated high school he'd been to twelve different schools and progressed from designing imaginary albums to recording real tracks at home. His first mixtape, 2009's Bastard was released the year of his graduation, Pitchfork named it the #32 best album of that year. Two years later the single "Yonkers" became a viral hit and led to the XL label signing him for the second album Goblin.  </p>
